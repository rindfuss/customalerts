# Custom Alerts iOS App

## On the App Store

## Source code highlights
 - Integration with the iOS calendar system. Custom Alerts simply reads and updates the calendar system already present in iOS rather than building a new, proprietary calendar database.
 - Real-time event listening so that if a user opens an event in Custom Alerts, switches to the iOS Calendar app, and makes a change to the event, Custom Alerts will see the change and update its display of the event accordingly.

## Background
In pre-iPhone days I regularly set alerts on my PalmPilot calendar events for time periods like 4 hours before the event or 3 days or even 6 weeks before the event. When I started using an iPhone I liked the built-in calendar app but discovered it only supported (and in 2020 still only supports) a small set of time periods for event alerts. I also discovered that I could set an alert to any period I wanted on the Mac calendar app, and it would sync properly to the iPhone, and the iPhone would alert me at the proper time. So, the underlying calendar system supported arbitrary alert time periods; it was just that the calendar app didn't let a user choose them. I created Custom Alerts with just one purpose: to let me set those alerts!
